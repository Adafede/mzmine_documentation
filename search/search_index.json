This tolerance window may need to be set higher that for classic LC-MS feature detection (e.g. to 0.005 m/z and 15-20 ppm instead of 10 ppm) due to lower intensities therefore less accuracy in individual mobility scans compared to LC-MS scans. Note that the overall accuracy is achieved via LC-IMS-MS is the same due to the higher number of scans. Minimum consecutive retention time data points \u00b6 This parameter specifies the number of consecutive detections of the same m/z value in a chromatographic peak (rt dimension only). This means that a single m/z has to be detected in, e.g, 5 frames with an intensity higher than zero. This parameter helps to filter noise. Consecutive detections in the mobility dimension do not affect this parameter. Usually no less than 5 should be set here if the MS1 acquisition rate is sufficient. Minimum total signals \u00b6 Specifies the total number of peaks in the mobility dimension in all mobility scans. Every \"dot\" in an ion mobility trace represents a single datapoint. ( see ion mobility traces ) Advanced parameters \u00b6 For most applications, these parameters do not need to set/altered. For high mobility resolved data the mobilograms might become noisy due to less ions reaching the detector at the same time. By default, the number of binned scans is set to cover about 0.0008 Vs/cm^2 per bin. The effect of binning can be seen here . If you are unsure about the nature of your data, you can perform trace building with the standard parameters and apply/preview the binning afterwards via the Feature detection \u2192 Mobilogram binning module. Processing result \u00b6 After performing ion mobiltiy trace detection, a feature list is created in the feature list tab (see feature lists tab ). In the feature table, multiple columns are created. The displayed columns can be set via the button on the right of the feature table ([1]). The shapes displays an EIC of the ion mobility trace (intensities summed in rt dimension). The mobilograms column shows a mobilogram for the ion mobility trace (intensities summed in mobility dimension). The shapes and projections can be smoothed and resolved. However, the ion mobility trace is always represented by the raw data and remains unaltered. After resolving, the shapes and mobilograms have to be recalculated from the raw data, which is why the smoothing is lost after resolving.","title":"Ion mobility trace builder"},{"location":"module_docs/ionmobilitytracebuilder/ion-mobility-trace-builder.html#ion-mobility-trace-builder","text":"The Ion mobility trace builder will build ion mobility traces from the raw data.

Well optimised parameters [1] can lead to recognition of all good features in a \"good\" EICs [2] and to few noise recognised as feature in EIC that also contains chromatographic noise [3]. On the other hand, poorly optimised parameters [4] can still lead to recognition of all features in a good EIC [5], but recognise a lot of noise as feature in a noisy EIC [6]. Therefore, we recommend optimising the parameters on good EICs and checking the results of these parameters with a noisy EIC. Most of the time, a noisy EIC can be found by sorting the feature table by decreasing area. Parameter settings \u00b6 MS/MS scan paring \u00b6 Selecting this parameter will pair DDA MS/MS spectra to the resolved features. This is optional at this stage, because it will be executed again during resolving in the mobility dimension. Dimension \u00b6 The dimension to be resolved can be selected here. Select Retention time . Chromatographic threshold \u00b6 This parameter is crucial for removing noise from chromatograms. If this parameter is set to, e.g., 50, the lowest 50 % of intensities will be removed. Since the all retention time in the data file are used for this determination, this value should be rather high (e.g., 95 %) to begin with and only lowered if necessary. Search minimum rt range (min) \u00b6 Determines the step size that will be scanned for individual peaks. Setting this value too low, can cause peak edges to be cut off, setting it too high might lead to incomplete separation of narrowly eluting compounds. Minimum relative height \u00b6 Determines the minimum relative intensity of a individual feature in relation to the highest intensity in the chromatogram. May lead to discrimination of low intensity features. Minimum absolute height \u00b6 Determines the minimum absolute intensity of a feature to be recognised by the algorithm. This parameter depends on what you want to detect, the instrument and detector type. Usually, Orbitrap instruments report higher intensities that TOF instruments. However, the noise level is also higher for Orbitrap than for TOF instruments. For TOF instruments 1E3 or even 5E2 can be appropriate, whilst Orbitraps can require 1E5 or 5E4. Min ration of peak top/edge \u00b6 Describes the minimum ratio of the highest point of a peak to the lowest point of a peak. This mostly affects detection of low intensity and not-baseline-resolved signals and should be optimised using such a signal as an example. Peak duration range \u00b6 Describes valid peak lengths. Can be used to filter out very short or long noise signals. Minimum number of data points \u00b6 Can be used in addition to Peak duration range to filter out noise. Should be set no lower than 5 in most cases. Ion mobility data \u00b6 In general, the same principles apply as in the retention time resolving step. However, a few differences shall be noted. In the screenshot you can also see, that the resolved mobilograms are recalculated from the raw data and previously apply smoothing steps are therefore lost and must be reapplied if necessary. Dimension \u00b6 Mobility has to be selected as a dimension to resolve mobilograms [1]. Chromatographic threshold \u00b6 Since there are less scans in mobility dimension (e.g., 400 - >1000 per frame, depending on the instrument type and setting) than in rt dimension (e.g. 5000 for LC-MS depending on acquisition rate), the threshold should be lowered to 80 or less. Search minimum range \u00b6 This value determines the search range in mobility dimension. Therefore, this value has to be set lower when resolving a TIMS (Bruker data) mobilogram, because the absolute numerical values are smaller (e.g., 0.01). When resolving mobilograms from Waters or Agilent data (mobility as drift time in ms), the values are higher and must therefore be increased.

Ions drift through the IM cell with different velocity based on their interaction with the buffer gas, which allows for the separation of different shaped molecules. Modern devieces are able to perform IM separation on a millisecond timescale, typically within 10 to 100 ms. Thus, IM nicely fits in-between LC separation (~seconds timescale) and MS detection of TOF instruments (~microseconds timescale). This allows LC-IM-MS insturments to acqurie several MS spectra during each accumulation , without incurring sensitivity loss. For example, assuming a typical 100 \u00b5s MS-acquisition time of TOF analyzers, around 1000 spectra can be recorded within 100 ms of IM separation. Therefore, as opposed to LC-MS, multiple MS (or MS2) spectra are associated to each RT in LC-IM-MS data. A more detailed explanation of LC-MS and LC-IMS-MS raw data structure is provided here . Trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) - Todo \u00b6 Trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) reverses the concept of traditional drift tube IM. Rather than moving ions through astationary gas, TIMS holds ions stationary against a moving gas and then releases them according to their mobility. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWjz32wky2A Time-dispersve ion mobility spectrometry (DTIMS and TWIMS) - Todo \u00b6 Time-dispersve IM devices include \"traditional\" drift tube (DTIMS) and travelling-wave (TWIMS) devices. In classic DTIM, ions migrate through aninert buffer gas under the influence of a weak electricfield, whereas collisions with buffer gas molecules retard theprogress of the ions. As larger ions have more collisions withthe gas, they are more strongly retarded than their smaller counterparts. Thus, smaller ions, having a smaller cross section, arrive earlier at the detector than ions with a larger collisional cross section (CCS). The ion mobility K is then defined as the ratio of the analyte's steady-state net drift velocity to the applied electric field, and it is convention toc alculate the reduced ion mobility K0 at standard pressur eand standard temperature, often reported as the inverse reduced ion mobility 1/K0. Terminology \u00b6 Accumulations, Mobility Scans and Frames \u00b6 Altough mainly used for TIMS, the term \" accumulation \" refers to the pack of ions gathered at the head of the IM device prior to the release and separation in the IM cell. As explained above , since the accumulation-separation cycle typically last ~100 ms, multiple MS spectra (referred to as \" mobility scans \" in MZmine) are acquired during each cycle. The set of mobility scans collected during each IM separation constitutes a \" frame \". A frame can be seen as the IM separation of a single accumulation , along which multiple MS spectra are collected. Several frames are contained within one LC peak. Thus, the frame number are a natural unit to measure chromatographic RT.

The first few steps are different for the two workflows (see below). LC-IMS-MS workflow via ADAP Chromatogram builder and IMS expander ( recommended) LC-IMS-MS workflow via Ion mobility trace builder / Recursive IMS builder While these lists might seem fairly similar, there are some differences in the processing approach. The LC-IMS-MS workflow builds ion mobility traces from the data in the mobility scans, whilst the LC-MS workflow builds EICs from the summed frames. For ion mobility data imported from .mzML files, accumulated frame spectra have to be built from the individual mobility scans after mass detection . Since the mass detection impacts the computation of accumulated frame spectra in the same way it would impact the ion mobility trace builder , the differences from this workflow and the ADAP workflow will be negligible. However, frame spectra for native Bruker .tdf raw data are summed by the vendor library during file import. Here, the frame spectra are generated from the raw data and thus result in higher intensities, since the low abundant data points on the edges of the mobility and retention time peaks are not cut-off by the mass detection step. (see below) Therefore, the more low abundant compounds might be detected, if the LC-MS workflow is recommended. LC-MS workflow (recommended) \u00b6 LC-IMS-MS data can also be processed via the regular LC-MS modules. If necessary, detected features can be expanded into the mobility dimension. For this workflow, generation of summed frame spectra via the Mobility scan merging module is a mandatory step, if the data was imported from an .mzML file (automatically generated via native Bruker import).

If smoother shapes are required, the smoothing can be reapplied afterwards. In that case, smoothing can be applied to both dimensions at once. LC-IMS-MS workflow \u00b6 The LC-IMS-MS workflow will directly build ion mobility traces from the raw data in the mobility scans. This workflow does not necessarily require summed frame spectra. However, if extracted ion chromatograms shall be visualized via the Chromatogram visualizer , the frame intensities are used. In case these are not present, the chromatograms will be blank. Note that feature intensities from the LC-IMS-MS workflow might not exactly match the frame chromatograms due to summing being executed prior to thresholding (for native Bruker data).

The LC-IMS-MS workflow builds ion mobility traces from the data in the mobility scans, whilst the LC-MS workflow builds EICs from the summed frames. For ion mobility data imported from .mzML files, accumulated frame spectra have to be built from the individual mobility scans after mass detection . Since the mass detection impacts the computation of accumulated frame spectra in the same way it would impact the ion mobility trace builder , the differences from this workflow and the ADAP workflow will be negligible. However, frame spectra for native Bruker .tdf raw data are summed by the vendor library during file import. Here, the frame spectra are generated from the raw data and thus result in higher intensities, since the low abundant data points on the edges of the mobility and retention time peaks are not cut-off by the mass detection step. (see below) Therefore, the more low abundant compounds might be detected, if the LC-MS workflow is recommended.","title":"Feature detection workflows"},{"location":"workflows/imsworkflow/Ion-mobility-data-processing-workflow.html#lc-ms-workflow-recommended","text":"LC-IMS-MS data can also be processed via the regular LC-MS modules.
