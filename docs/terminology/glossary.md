# Terminology

### Full scan acqusition mode
In full scan acquisition mode, the mass spectrometer acquires [...]. Full scan spectra are often, as well as in MZmine, referred to as MS spectra.

### MS2 data-dependent acqusition mode
In data-dependent acquisition (DDA) schemes, the mass spectrometer detects 'suitable' precursor ions in each MS scan and selects them for fragmentation in consecutive MS2 scans.
- 'Cycle time' and 'topN' acquisition schemes

### Feature
Pair of m/z and retention time, normally associated with a signal intensity. The term ‘feature’ is used to emphasize the 3D nature of the signal, as opposed to the term ‘peak’, which is typically used for 2D datasets (e.g., m/z in a mass spectrum).
