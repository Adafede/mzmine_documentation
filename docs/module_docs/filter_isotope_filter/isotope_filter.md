# <sup>13</sup>C isotope filter 

MZmine carries out the featrure detection steps of [_chromatogram builing_](../featdet_adap_chromatogram_builder/adap-chromatogram-builder.md) and subsequent [_resolving_](../featdet_resolver_local_minimum/local-minimum-resolver.md) considering all the signals stored in the [_mass lists_](../../terminology/general-terminology.md#mass-list). As a consequence, signals generated by the isotopes of the same chemical entity (see [_isotopic pattern_](../../terminology/general-terminology.md#isotopic-pattern)) will be detected as distinct features and included in the [_feature lists_](../../terminology/general-terminology.md#feature-list). This frequently happens for the <sup>13</sup>C isotopic signals due to the relative high abundance of <sup>13</sup>C in nature (_i.e._ <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C â‰ˆ 1.1%).

The _13C isotope filter_ module (formerly called _Isotope grouper_) aims at filtering out the features corresponding to the <sup>13</sup>C isotopes of the same molecule as they would represent redundant informations in the downstream data analysis. The algorithm consider each feature in the _feature lists_ individually and checks for the presence of potential <sup>13</sup>C peak(s). When an isotope pattern meeting the user-defined tolerances (e.g. _m/z_, RT) and requirements (e.g. _monotonic shape_) is found, the information (_i.e._ charge, isotope ratios) is saved, <sup>13</sup>C-related features are removed and the highest isotope is retained. It must be noted that <sup>13</sup>C peaks are searched within the _feature list_, and not in the raw data.

#### **Name suffix**
String added as suffix to when creating the new feature list(s).

#### **m/z tolerance**
Maximum allowed difference between two features' m/z values in order for them to be considered the same. The value is specified both as absolute tolerance (in m/z) and relative tolerance (in ppm). The tolerance range is calculated using maximum of the absolute and relative tolerances.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**. MZmine 'naively' add MZMINE ADDS 1.00335 (mass of the XXX) to the checked feature _m/z_ and do not check for the fine isotopic distribution. Therefore, we recommend to be strict in setting this tolerance in order not to filter out other signals. 

#### **Retention time tolerance**
Maximum allowed difference between the retention time values of two features that will taken into account when performing the <sup>13</sup>C isotope filtering .

#### **Mobility tolerance**
If enabled(and mobility dimension was recorded), isotopic peaks will only be grouped if they fit the given tolerance.

#### **Monotonic shape**
If true, then monotonically decreasing height of isotope pattern is required.This is usually the case for ^13^C isotope pattern of small molecules.

#### **Maximum charge**
Maximum charge to consider for detecting the isotope patterns. The charge state with the maximum number of detected isotope features will be used.

#### **Never remove feature with MS2**
If checked, all features with MS2 are retained without applying any further filters on them. 

#### **Original feature lists**
The input feature list can either be kept, removed, or directly filtered (PROCESS IN PLACE). This allows for more control over memory usage. Where available, in place processing is the most performant.
