# Spectral library search

The spectral library search can be performed on feature lists, feature rows, or single scans. Depending on the MS level (MS1 or MS2), all corresponding rows will be matched against selected spectral libraries that were previously imported (formats: .json, .mgf, .msp, or .jdx).

## Supported library formats
- .json: MassBank of North America (MoNA) ([downlod](https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/downloads))
- .json:
