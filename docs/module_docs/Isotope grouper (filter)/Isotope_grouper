##### Name suffix
Suffix to be added to feature list name.

##### m/z tolerance
Maximum allowed difference between two m/z values in order for them to be considered the same. The value is specified both as absolute tolerance (in m/z) and relative tolerance (in ppm). The tolerance range is calculated using maximum of the absolute and relative tolerances.

##### Retention time tolerance
Maximum allowed difference between two retention time values.

##### Mobility tolerance
If enabled(and mobility dimension was recorded), isotopic peaks will only be grouped if they fit the given tolerance.

##### Monotonic shape
If true, then monotonically decreasing height of isotope pattern is required.

##### Maximum charge
Maximum charge to consider for detecting the isotope patterns.

##### Remove original feature lists
If checked, original feature lists will be removed and only deisotoped version remains.
