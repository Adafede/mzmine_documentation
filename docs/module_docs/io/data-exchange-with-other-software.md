# **Data export to other software**

[//]: # (TODO Check if all works for the latest versions of the software)

## **Description**

MZmine3 output data can be easily exchanges with other software, allowing a user to perform additional downstream analysis.

## **MetaboAnalyst export**

### **Description**

:material-menu-open: **Feature list methods → Export feature list → MetaboAnalyst export**

This module exports the contents of the peak list into a csv file formatted. This csv file can be easily uploaded into the **Statistical Analysis** module of the **MetaboAnalyst** service. 

!!! warning

     Prior to export, samples must be separated into groups by a user-defined parameter (see :material-menu-open: Project →  Set sample parameters menu). Each group must contain at least 3 samples (raw data files).

#### **Format of exported CSV file**

The exported file is formatted as shown below. Each feature is represented by its ID in the feature list, m/z value (formatted according to MZmine configuration), retention time value (formatted according to MZmine configuration), and the preferred identity (name).

     "Sample","ko15","ko16","ko18","ko19","ko21","ko22","wt15","wt16","wt18","wt19","wt21","wt22"
     "Label","KO","KO","KO","KO","KO","KO","WT","WT","WT","WT","WT","WT"

### **Parameters**

Filename
Name of exported CSV file for MetaboAnalyst. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.
Grouping parameter
Project parameter that will be used to obtain group information to each sample (e.g. control vs disease). Please set parameters in the Project/Set sample parameters menu.



Uploading to MetaboAnalyst

In MetaboAnalyst, please select the Statistical Analysis module.



After selecting the Statistical Analysis module, please set the parameters as shown below. In the "Data File" field, please select the CSV file generated by this MZmine module.



For details about MetaboAnalyst functions and capabilities, please refer to its documentation.



## R-based software

With R, being one of the most popular programming languages for the bioinformatics applications, MZmine suggests a possibility to export its results with great flexibility.

## **Tidymass**

Tidymass can import the csv feature table from MZmine, see tidymass tutorial: https://www.tidymass.org/start/create_mass_dataset/#mzmine-feature-table-to-mass_dataset-class


### MetDNA 

MetDNA also works with MZmine results:

### NetID

From NetID paper: Data input: NetID requires, first, a peak table (in .csv format) containing m/z, retention time and intensity from high-resolution mass spectrometry data -> should do with csv export
