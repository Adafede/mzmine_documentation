# **Raw data overview (LC-MS)**

Raw data overview allows user to explore both chromatogram and MS views across all the selected files. If the several files are chosen, they will be displayed in one plot.

The view consists of three panes - chromatogram representation (on the left), mass spectrum (on the right), and table with tabs containing additional information about raw data files.

To display an XIC view of chromatograms in a defined m/z range user can tick an option "Show XIC". m/z range can be either defined manually or generated automatically.
