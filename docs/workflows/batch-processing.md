# Batch processing

Besides the interactive [GUI](../Main-window-overview.md), MZmine allows the user to run data processing workflows in a fully automated manner through the the so-called "batch mode". Established pipelines can be run with just few clicks, or even through the command-line application. This makes MZmine suitable to integrate into automated data analysis pipelines (e.g. QC systems)

## **How to run batch processing**
To open the batch mode go to Project :material-arrow-right-thin: Batch mode in the main menu.

Batch files (XML format) are essentially lists of tasks run by MZmine one after another. Any of the methods available in MZmine 3 can be included in the batch file.
